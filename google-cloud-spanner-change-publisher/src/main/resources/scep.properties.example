# Maximum time that the JVM should wait for the publisher to shutdown when the JVM is shutting
# down. When the JVM is shutdown, scep will stop the Pubsub publisher and the Spanner change
# watcher and close any resources in use. This should normally finish within a couple of seconds.
# If the shutdown has not finished within the below timeout, the JVM shutdown will proceed without
# any further waiting on Pubsub and Spanner.  

scep.maxWaitForShutdownSeconds=20


# ----- SPANNER SETTINGS ------ #
# Settings for Spanner watcher.

# The database to watch for changes.
# The project only needs to be set if the default project ID of the environment is not the
# project that should be used.

# used.

# ----- TABLE SELECTION ----- #

# The tables in the database to watch for changes. By default, the watcher will monitor all tables
# in the database that have a column with the option ALLOW_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP=TRUE for changes. This
# can be changed by specifying a value for either includedTables or excludedTables.

# Turn watching all tables in the database for changes on/off.

# A list of tables that should be excluded from monitoring. This option may only be used in
# combination with the option allTables=true. You do not need to exclude tables that do not have a
# column with the option ALLOW_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP=TRUE. Those tables will automatically be excluded.

#scep.spanner.excludedTables=TABLE1,TABLE2,TABLE3


# A list of tables that should be included in the monitoring. This option may only be used in
# combination with the option allTables=false.

# ----- PUBSUB SETTINGS ----- #

# Settings for the Pubsub topic(s) where the changes should be published.
# The project only needs to be set if the default project ID of the environment is not the
# project that should be used. The Pubsub project ID and Spanner project ID may be different.

# Cloud credentials of the environment are not the one that should be used.

# The ConverterFactory to use to convert a Cloud Spanner row to a serializable format that
# can be published as a Pubsub message. The value for this property should be the fully
# qualified class name of a class that implements the com.google.cloud.spanner.publisher.ConverterFactory
# interface. If no converter is configured, com.google.cloud.spanner.publisher.SpannerToAvroFactory
# will be used. This will publish the changes as Avro records. The below example configures
# the publisher to publish the changes in JSON format.

scep.pubsub.converterFactory=com.google.cloud.spanner.publisher.SpannerToJsonFactory


# Sets the Pubsub Topic(s) where the changes should be published. All changes can be published to
# both a single topic or different topics for different tables. The topicNameFormat may contain a
# number of placeholders that will automatically be replaced with the actual values.
# 
# The possible placeholders are:
# * %project%:  The project id of the Cloud Spanner database.
# * %instance%: The instance id of the Cloud Spanner database.
# * %database%: The database id of the Cloud Spanner database.
# * %catalog%:  The catalog name of the Cloud Spanner table.
# * %schema%:   The schema name of the Cloud Spanner table.
# * %table%:    The table name of the Cloud Spanner table.
# 
# This example will publish the changes to topics with names like
# 'projects/my-pubsub-project/topics/spanner-update-my-database-TABLE1' and
# 'projects/my-pubsub-project/topics/spanner-update-my-database-TABLE2' etc.
