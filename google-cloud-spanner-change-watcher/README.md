# Spanner Change Watcher

## Introduction
Spanner Change Watcher watches Spanner databases and tables for changes and
emits events when changes are detected. This framework can be included in an
existing application and used to trigger functionality or processes in that
application based on data change events.

A further introduction to Spanner Change Watcher [can be found here](https://medium.com/@knutolavloite/cloud-spanner-change-publisher-7fbee48f66f8).

## Example Usage
Spanner Change Watcher can be used to watch both single tables, a set of tables,
or entire databases. Add the dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.cloudspannerecosystem</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-cloud-spanner-change-watcher</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Watch Single Table
Watches a single table in a Spanner database for changes.

```java
String instance = "my-instance";
String database = "my-database";
String table = "MY_TABLE";

Spanner spanner = SpannerOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService();
TableId tableId =
    TableId.of(DatabaseId.of(SpannerOptions.getDefaultProjectId(), instance, database), table);
SpannerTableChangeWatcher watcher = SpannerTableTailer.newBuilder(spanner, tableId).build();
watcher.addCallback(
    new RowChangeCallback() {
      @Override
      public void rowChange(TableId table, Row row, Timestamp commitTimestamp) {
        System.out.printf(
            "Received change for table %s: %s%n", table, row.asStruct().toString());
      }
    });
watcher.startAsync().awaitRunning();
```

### Watch Entire Database
Watches all tables in a Spanner database for changes.

```java
String instance = "my-instance";
String database = "my-database";

Spanner spanner = SpannerOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService();
DatabaseId databaseId = DatabaseId.of(SpannerOptions.getDefaultProjectId(), instance, database);
SpannerDatabaseChangeWatcher watcher =
    SpannerDatabaseTailer.newBuilder(spanner, databaseId).allTables().build();
watcher.addCallback(
    new RowChangeCallback() {
      @Override
      public void rowChange(TableId table, Row row, Timestamp commitTimestamp) {
        System.out.printf(
            "Received change for table %s: %s%n", table, row.asStruct().toString());
      }
    });
watcher.startAsync().awaitRunning();
```

### Performance
* See [this article](https://medium.com/@knutolavloite/scaling-up-spanner-change-watcher-82315fbc8962) for more information on how to scale Spanner Change Watcher for large tables using a secondary index that contains a (computed) shard column and the commit timestamp column.
* See [this article](https://medium.com/@knutolavloite/benchmark-spanner-change-watcher-e5b6cc2ac618) for more information on how to benchmark different configurations of Spanner Change Watcher using the built-in Benchmark Application in the samples directory.

### Further Samples
Take a look at [Samples.java](../samples/spanner-change-watcher-samples/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/spanner/watcher/sample/Samples.java)
for additional examples of more advanced use cases.

## Limitations
* Spanner Change Watcher and Spanner Change Publisher by default use
  [commit timestamps](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/commit-timestamp) to determine when a
  change has occurred. Tables that do not include a commit timestamp can also be monitored, but require
  the creation of an additional CHANGE_SETS table that registers all read/write transactions.
* Deletes are not detected, unless these are soft deletes that only update a deleted flag in the corresponding table.
* Spanner Change Watcher polls tables for changes. Polling on larger tables can take some time and cause some delay
  before a change is detected. The default poll interval is 1 second and is configurable. It does support sharding to
  reduce the load on large tables. It is also possible to use an additional CHANGE_SETS table that registers all
  read/write transactions, and only poll this table using a SpannerTableChangeSetPoller instead of polling the data tables.
  Take a look at the samples for more information.
* Spanner Change Watcher emits changes on a row level basis, including the commit timestamp of the change. It does not
  emit an event containing all changes of a single transaction. If that is needed, the client application will need to
  group the row level changes together based on the commit timestamp.
* Spanner Change Watcher is not a managed solution and does not come with Cloud Spanner's SLO.

Please feel free to report issues and send pull requests, but note that this
application is not officially supported as part of the Cloud Spanner product.
