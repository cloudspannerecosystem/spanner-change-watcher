## Introduction
Samples for [Spanner Change Publisher](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/spanner-change-watcher/tree/master/google-cloud-spanner-change-publisher).

Spanner Change Publisher watches a Spanner database for changes and publishes
these changes to Pubsub. It can monitor a single table, a set of tables, or all
tables in a database.

Spanner Change Publisher can be included in an existing application, or it can
be deployed as a standalone application.
